# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

We initiated this analysis project to sort data into more easily analyzed groupings so that employer Pewlett Hackard could determine how many of their employees were approaching retirement. This information is important as it will give Pewlett Hackard the ability to properly plan on how many new employees need to be hired to maintain a proper workforce. We were first given several CSV files containing seperated information concerning employees, departments, managers, salaries, and job titles. We were able to link this information together through shared primary keys, as shown in the image below.
